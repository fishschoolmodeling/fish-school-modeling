# Description
<p>This project aims to simulate homogeneous schooling behavior of fish through interactive Unity 2D environment using Reinforcement Learning. These simulated fish (agents) exhibit schooling behavior (where fish travel in the same direction while keeping adequate distance,) foraging behavior (where fish are able to locate "food zones" and approach them to satiate themselves,) and evasion (where fish avoid collision with the wall and the predator.)</p>
